# How this library is versioned

As of `v2.0.2` this library _strictly_ adheres to [semver](https://semver.org)'s major.minor.patch versioning:

- patch version changes indicate bug fixes and/or internal-only code changes,
- minor version changes indicate new functionality that does not break backward compatibility,
- major version changes indicate backward-incompatible external API changes, no matter how small.

Note that there may be gaps in the version history, which may happen if a release is pushed to npm but a problem is discovered fast enough to warrant an unpublish.

# Version history

## v3.0.0

- major version update, as `currentPoint` was renamed to `currentMovable` in v2.1.0
- fixed a bug in the code responsible for tracking the `currentMovable` delta

## v2.2.0

- added support for variable presets using `data-*` attributes, (see the
  "[Using data-\* attributes](./docs.html#using-data-attributes)" section on
  the documentation page for more information.
- added documentation for handling load/error events, see the
  "[Load and error events](#load-and-error-events)" section on the documentation
  page for more information.
- added code that ensures that the `GraphicsElement` class exists globally as part
  of loading the custom element.

**NOTE**: This release was given the wrong version number, as it includes the
breaking change that renamed `currentPoint` to `currentMovable`.

## v2.1.0

- added `startShape`, `endShape`, and `newSegment` for working with shapes. At present
  shapes can only be used to model polygonal edges, but these will be extended in a
  future version to allow for curved edges.

**NOTE**: This release was given the wrong version number, as it introduced a
breaking change that renamed `currentPoint` to `currentMovable`.
