# The `<graphics-element>` custom HTML element

What if you could just put graphics on your web page, or in your web app, by just writing graphics JavaScript code and then using a &lt;graphics-element src="..."&gt; the same way you'd put regular JavaScript on a page using a &lt;script&gt; tag? As it turns out, that's not a "what if", it's something that the modern web supports, so if that's something you want, or need: maybe the &lt;graphics-element&gt; is for you!
