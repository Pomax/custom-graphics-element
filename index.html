    <h1>Putting (interactive) graphics on a web page</h1>

    <p>
      Once up on a time I was involved in
      <a href="http://processingjs.org">Processing.js</a>, a JS port (as best as
      we could do at a time before ES6) of the
      <a href="https://processing.org">Processing language</a>, a visual
      programming language that, to this day, I will whip out whenever I need to
      do some quick trig. And as much as I know why Processing.js is now an
      archived project on github (because I was the one who archived it), I
      still miss it, and I frequently write web pages that would seriously
      benefit from having some interactive graphics on the page. Sure, there's
      <a href="https://p5js.org">P5.js</a> which answers the question "what if
      the web was what it is today, back when the idea of Processing was born",
      but it's not the same. For me, at least. It's a completely different API,
      with a very different "feel", if that makes sense.
    </p>

    <p>
      My most graphics-intensive website is my
      <a href="https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo">Primer on Bezier curves</a>,
      and that ended up being enough work that I wrote a special graphics
      element for it, that allowed me to write "Processing-ish" code that it
      would server-side render the first frame as placeholder image for, and
      then PWA-style load the real graphic on top of for interactive goodness.
      So what if... I turn that into a web component? Just something you stick
      on a page as a &lt;graphics-element src="..."&gt;&lt;/graphics-element&gt;
      and then you just write your visual thing using a Processing-like flavour
      of JS, with some magic sprinkled in so you're not writing "this." all over
      the place?
    </p>

    <p>
      ...so, yeah, this is that. Let's put some interactive graphics right onto
      the page, using the magic of a custom element. Here's one: it shows the
      result of a
      <a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proportional%E2%80%93integral%E2%80%93derivative_controller"
        >PID controller</a
      >
      on an input signal, with the red curve being the input, and the green
      curve being the adjustment the PID controller tries to effect at every
      time step. The important thing in this function plot is that the red curve
      isn't "static", we don't have an input, and output, and then we mix it:
      the input and output at any given time <b>t</b>
      <em>becomes the next input</em>. So it's a constant feedback loop. What
      happens when we vary the Proportional, Integral, and Derivative factors?
    </p>

    <graphics-element
      title="an example using a PID controller"
      src="./pid-example.js"
    ></graphics-element>

    <p>
      Of course, that's only slider-based interaction, how about actual
      interaction? The processing-like library that backs this doesn't require
      you to write your own mouse/touch handling for things like "this point
      should be click-draggable", you instead say which points can be moved
      around, and done: they can now be moved around.
    </p>

    <p>
      In fact, click that "view source" link. I want you to be able to see the
      source code that makes cool things be cool. Because I want you to be able
      to make cool things, too. Let's make the web cool again.
    </p>

    <graphics-element
      title="an example with interactive points"
      src="./point-example.js"
    ></graphics-element>

    <p>
      And make no mistake: that "view source" link is baked in. No pretending
      that your graphics are somehow artisanal, bespoke, and super secret: this
      is the web. Anyone can view the source code. It's what made the web great,
      and it's what giant internet conglomerate coorporations literally want to
      get rid of so they can call the shots. Sorry did I say "want"? I should
      have used passed tense, because in many parts of the world they they
      <em>actually succeeded in this already</em> and it's insane. Let's take
      back the web.
    </p>

    <p>
      Bit of a tangent, so let's get back to graphics elements: being able to
      move things around is pretty sweet, but sometimes you just want to show
      off an animation, and yeah: this can do that, too. Again, click the "view
      source" link to see what's required, but other than the parts that
      actually draw the funky bits, it's very little, and if you know JS already
      , probably trivial.
    </p>

    <graphics-element
      title="an example with a play button as well as tap-to-play"
      src="./animated-example.js"
      ><button>play</button></graphics-element
    >

    <p>
      This is the kind of thing I wish I had available back when I had to
      archive Processing.js due to a lack of devs, and frankly, interest. The
      need to make cool graphics hasn't gone away. Only the tools to let you do
      so. So hopefully this tool enables at least <em>some</em> folks to make
      <em>some</em> cool things that they otherwise wouldn't have.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I use this?</h2>

    <p>
      Still working on that because you probably just want a CDN link that you
      can put on your own page, which doesn't exist (...yet?) so in the mean
      time there's a
      <a href="https://github.com/Pomax/custom-graphics-element">github repo</a
      >.
    </p>

    <h2>How do I contact you</h2>
