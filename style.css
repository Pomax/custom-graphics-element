  We can use the :defined pseudo-class to check whether a particular
  element is considered a "real" element (either by being a built-in
  standard HTML element, or a registered custom element) or whether it's
  just "a tag name that isn't tied to anything".

  If JS is disabled, as well as when the JS for registering our custom
  element is still loading, our <graphics-element> will just be "a word"
  and so we want to make sure to not show any content, except for the
  <fallback-image>, if there is one.

  So, first off: hide everything!
